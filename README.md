# draw-programme
The draw programme generates metapost code to draw diagrams from labelled peer codes or Gauss codes. It is currently able to draw a variety of knots and links: classical, virtual, welded and flat, and (multi-)knotoids, which was the original motivation.

The programme can also draw a set of smoothed states for a given diagram, as used by various invariants based on state sums, or the convex triangulation of a disc determined by a peer code.
