# draw-programme
The draw programme generates metapost code to draw diagrams from labelled peer codes or Gauss codes. It is currently able to draw a variety of knots and links: classical, virtual, welded and flat, (multi-)knotoids, and multi-linkoids

The programme can also draw diagrams that are related to knot diagrams:

	A set of smoothed states for a given diagram, as used by various invariants based on state sums
	An individual smoothed state, as specified by the user
	The convex triangulation of a disc determined by a peer code
	A set of Seifert-circles for a given diagram
	A Hamiltonian circuit for a classical or flat diagram (including doodles), the first one found by the search algorithm
	A Hamiltonian circuit as specified by the user
	All Hamiltonian circuits for the given diagram
